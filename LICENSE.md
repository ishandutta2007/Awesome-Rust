#### `LICENSE` (create file, choose **CC0 1.0 Universal** when GitHub prompts, or paste this)

You can just use GitHub’s license picker → **Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal**.

### 3. Final touches after pushing

1. In repo **Settings → General**:
   - Add **Topics**: `rust`, `awesome`, `awesome-list`, `curated`, `resources`, `learning`, `projects`
2. Enable **Discussions** (great for suggestions)
3. (Optional) Add a GitHub Actions workflow later to validate links if you want.

### 4. First PR you can make yourself

Add your own favorite Rust project/app right after you push the initial README — it’ll look active immediately.

You now have a clean, professional, **distinct** `Awesome-Rust` repo that complements (instead of duplicates) the unofficial one.

Push it and drop the link here — I’ll help you expand any section (CLI, web, games, etc.) with more curated entries whenever you want! 🚀
