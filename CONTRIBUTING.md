# Contributing to Awesome Rust

Thank you for helping!

## Rules

1. **Only high-quality, actively maintained projects** (≥10 stars, recent commits, or very popular).
2. **One line per entry** in this format:
3. [Project Name](https://github.com/user/repo) – Short, compelling description.
4. Add new entries in alphabetical order within each section.
5. No duplicates (check the whole list).
6. No crates that are just wrappers unless they add significant value.
7. Projects must be Rust-first (or have a substantial Rust component).
